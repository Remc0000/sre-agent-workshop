# Module 4: Configure Incident Response (~20 min)

## Overview

Set up Azure Monitor as your incident platform and create a response plan so the SRE Agent automatically investigates alerts and takes action.

## Connect Azure Monitor

The SRE Agent can respond to incidents from multiple sources (Azure Monitor, PagerDuty, custom webhooks, etc.). For this workshop, we'll use Azure Monitor — the native Azure alerting platform that's already collecting metrics from your AKS cluster.

### Connect the Incident Platform

1. In the SRE Agent portal, look for **Builder** in the left sidebar
2. Click **Incident platform**
3. You'll see a dropdown showing "Not connected" or no platform selected
4. Click the dropdown and select **Azure Monitor**
5. The portal will ask if you want to enable the **Quickstart response plan** — **turn this OFF** (we'll create our own custom plan so you understand what's happening)
6. Click **Save**
7. Wait for a green checkmark or "Azure Monitor connected" confirmation

### What Just Happened

The agent has now established a connection to your Azure Monitor. When alerts fire in Azure Monitor, they'll flow into the SRE Agent via an alert action rule or webhook. The agent will see each alert in real time and decide whether to investigate based on the incident response plan you're about to create.

## Create an Incident Response Plan

An incident response plan tells the agent *which* alerts to respond to and *how* to respond (investigate only, or investigate + remediate).

### Start the Wizard

1. Still in the **Builder** section, click **Incident response plans**
2. Click **New incident response plan**

### Step 1: Set Up Filters

The filter defines which alerts trigger this plan.

- **Name:** Enter `workshop-all-incidents`
- **Severity:** Select **All severity levels**

In a production environment, you might create separate plans for Critical, Warning, and Info alerts with different response strategies. For this workshop, we want to catch *everything* so you can observe the agent in action.

3. Click **Next**

### Step 2: Preview Matching Incidents

The wizard shows you past incidents that would have matched this plan. You might see:
- No previous incidents (if this is your first time setting up monitoring) — this is fine
- Some historical alerts from your AKS cluster (if you have them) — good, this shows your rule will match real incidents

4. Click **Next** to continue

### Step 3: Save and Set Autonomy

This step is important — it controls how much the agent is allowed to do automatically.

- **Agent autonomy level:** Select **Autonomous**

| Autonomy Level | Behavior | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| **Review** | Agent investigates, identifies root cause, proposes fixes, and waits for human approval before taking action | Production systems, high-risk changes |
| **Autonomous** | Agent investigates, identifies root cause, and automatically takes approved actions (like opening PRs or restarting pods) without waiting for approval | Non-production, trusted automation, this workshop |

For the workshop, **Autonomous** is perfect. It lets you watch the agent work end-to-end without needing to approve each step. In production, you'd typically start with **Review** mode for 2-4 weeks while you build confidence in the agent's decision-making. Once you're approving the same types of fixes repeatedly, you can graduate to Autonomous for those specific scenarios.

4. Click **Save**

You should now see your incident response plan listed in the **Incident response plans** section.

## Verify Alert Rules Exist

Your AKS cluster should already have Azure Monitor alert rules from the Bicep deployment in Module 1. Let's verify:

```bash
az monitor metrics alert list --resource-group rg-srelab -o table
```

You should see at least one alert rule. For example:
- **Container restart count** — fires if pod restarts spike
- **Pod failure** — fires if pods enter Failed state
- **Application error rate** — fires if 5xx errors spike (if you enabled Application Insights monitoring)

If the list is empty, the Bicep deployment didn't create alerts. No problem — you can create a simple one manually:

```bash
az monitor metrics alert create \
  --name container-restart-alert \
  --resource-group rg-srelab \
  --scopes /subscriptions/{SUBSCRIPTION_ID}/resourcegroups/rg-srelab/providers/microsoft.containerservice/managedclusters/srelab-aks \
  --description "Alert on container restarts" \
  --condition "avg restart_count > 5" \
  --window-size 5m \
  --evaluation-frequency 1m \
  --severity 3
```

(Replace `{SUBSCRIPTION_ID}` with your subscription ID from `az account show --query id -o tsv`)

## How It All Connects

Here's the flow when something goes wrong:

```
1. Azure Monitor Alert fires
   ↓
2. Alert flows to SRE Agent (via incident platform connection)
   ↓
3. Agent acknowledges alert and starts investigating
   ↓
4. Agent queries Azure Monitor logs & metrics
   ↓
5. Agent checks deployment history & code changes
   ↓
6. Agent correlates log errors with recent commits
   ↓
7. Agent proposes fix OR executes fix (based on autonomy level)
```

In your case, when the app starts failing in Module 5, Azure Monitor will detect the spike in errors. The SRE Agent will pick up the alert, query the app's logs, see authentication failures, check the Bicep deployment history, find the removed role assignment, and either propose or automatically open a PR to restore it.

## What Happens Next

In **Module 5: Break It**, we'll intentionally introduce a fault by editing the Bicep template to remove the CosmosDB role assignment. When the change deploys:

1. The app will start failing to authenticate to CosmosDB
2. Azure Monitor will detect the error spike
3. The SRE Agent will pick up the alert and begin investigating
4. In **Module 6: Watch SRE Agent**, you'll observe the agent's investigation in real time

Now that incident response is configured, you're ready to introduce the fault.
